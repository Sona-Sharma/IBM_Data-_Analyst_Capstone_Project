# IBM_Data_Analyst_Capstone_Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project! In this project, I have been hired by a global IT and business consulting services firm renowned for its expertise in IT solutions, 
and a team of highly experienced IT consultants. My main task is to analyze data to identify future skill requirements, enabling the organization to stay competitive in the ever-changing 
technological landscape.

## Project Objective

As a Data Analyst, my primary objective is to collect data from various sources such as job postings, training portals, and surveys. The goal is to identify the top programming skills in 
demand, the most sought-after database skills, and popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

## Project Tasks

1. Data Collection:I will start by scraping data from internet websites and accessing APIs to gather information from diverse sources,
                   including job postings, training portals, and surveys. The collected data will be stored in various formats such as .csv files,
                   excel sheets, and databases.

2. Data Wrangling: Once I have obtained the necessary data, I will apply data wrangling techniques to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

3. Data Analysis: Using statistical techniques, I will analyze the data to identify trends, insights, and patterns regarding the most in-demand programming
                  languages, top database skills, and popular IDEs.

4. Presentation: Finally, I will leverage my storytelling skills to present my findings through a well-structured presentation, showcasing the emerging skill trends for this year.

I'm excited to delve into this project and provide valuable insights to help the organization stay ahead in the competitive IT landscape. Stay tuned for updates and feel free to explore 
the repository for code, data, and the final presentation. Your feedback and suggestions are most welcome!
